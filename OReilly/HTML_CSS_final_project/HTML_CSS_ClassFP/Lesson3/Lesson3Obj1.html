<h1>Food Obsession</h1>
<p>I go through periods of time when I am <strong>obsessed</strong> with certain foods, eating them by the tons. (OK. That might be a slight exaggeration. Slight.) And then my taste for them wanes. Sometimes permanently. Other times temporarily. For example, I recently circled back around to eating a lot of wakame salad. Previously, I was into nametake, but you may notice that nametake is not currently on my list of foods I am obsessed with. </p>
<p>Here is a color-coded list of foods that I am currently eating a lot. </p>
<ul>
<li class="brusselgreen">Roasted Brussel sprouts</li>
<li class="purple">Eggplant</li>
<li class="brown">Korean mushroom soft tofu soup</li>
<li class="wakamegreen">Wakame salad</li>
</ul>
