<h1>Hamsters: Who Knew There Were So Many Different Types?!</h1>

<p>I had golden and teddy bears hamsters in my youth, but since then the types of hamsters have proliferated. 
I looked into getting a dwarf hamster some years ago, but shied away from them after I heard that they 
tend to get nervous and pee in your hands. (Something I could do without.)</p>

<h2>Logic Behind the Table Structure</h2>
<p>Why did I choose this data and what was my decision-making process for structuring the table to best 
manage that data?
For instance, why did I pick rows or columns for the table headings?
Did I create a separate cell for each item of data or did I combine some pieces of data, and if so, why? </p>

<p>The fact that there were so many different genus and species suggested that it would be best to use vertical table 
headers (with &lt;th&gt; in each &lt;tr&gt;) rather than horizontal ones (with all &lt;th&gt; in one &lt;tr&gt;). 
I put each category in a table row with the description of the particular species 
in a table cell (&lt;td&gt;) in the same row. So each row had a header (e.g., subfamily, genus, species) and 
possibly a description (e.g., Mongolian hamster).</p>

<p><span class="problem">Problem:</span> This created a problem when I validated the file. All of my rows did 
not have the same number of columns. I received the error message: A table row was 2 columns wide 
and exceeded the column count established by the first row (1). Solution: Since some &lt;tr&gt; did not have both
&lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt;, I added the attribute colspan="2" to the sole &lt;th&gt; or &lt;td&gt; tag in 
the &lt;tr&gt;.</p>

<h2>Logic Behind the Table Styling and Its Impact on the HTML</h2>
<p>I set up general styling with a rule for &lt;body&gt;. I found that I liked the table having default borders, which allowed 
the background color to come through in between the rows in the table, so I did not collapse the table borders. </p>

<p><span class="problem">Problem:</span> I wanted the text in the header/the first column of the table 
to have a separate style from the second column. Solution: I set up a rule for &lt;th&gt; in the CSS.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Next problem:</span> I didn&apos;t want the table to fill the entire browser window. 
Solution: I set up a rule for &lt;td&gt; and added a width that looked visually pleasing to the rules 
for &lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt;.</p>

<p><span class="problem">Next problem:</span> I wanted to call out the rows that only had a header and no other cells, namely the subfamily 
and genus rows, and make them bold. Solution: By default, all &lt;th&gt; tags are bold. To make only the &lt;th&gt; 
with subfamily and genus bold, I added font-weight: normal; to the body rule; created two classes (subfamily and genus) 
for the &lt;tr&gt; tags that contained subfamily and genus th; and created a rule for these classes
(tr.subfamily th, tr.genus th) that set the font-weight to bold. </p>

<p><span class="problem">Next problem:</span> Some genus classes had extra text in parentheses that 
I didn&apos;t want bold. By creating a rule for tr.subfamily th, tr.genus th and 
setting the font-weight to bold, all text in these &lt;th&gt; tags had become bold. 
Solution: I added a &lt;span&gt; tag with a class of &quot;tabheader&quot; around these items 
(e.g., (golden hamsters)) and added a rule to the CSS (tr span.tabheader) to set the font-weight back to normal. </p>

<p><span class="problem">Next problem:</span> I wanted to style the &lt;source&gt; content. Solution: I set up an id 
for &quot;source&quot; and then wrote various rules for the text as well as the link behavior. I also set up links
elsewhere on the page to display only some of this behavior (e.g., links with the class "table").</p><br><br>
