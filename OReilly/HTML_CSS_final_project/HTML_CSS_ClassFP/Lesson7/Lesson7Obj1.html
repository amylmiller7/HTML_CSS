<h1>Leo Buscaglia</h1>
<p>I loved reading Leo Buscaglia back in the &apos;80s. His words radiated such warmth, caring, and joy. He really seemed to enjoy life and people. And his words were often inspiring. </p>
<p>He nailed the dynamics of learning well: it happens through curiosity and is intimately connected to play.</p>
<p id="pullquote">"It is paradoxical that many educators and parents still differentiate between a time for learning and a time for play without seeing the vital connection between them."
~ Leo Buscaglia </p>
