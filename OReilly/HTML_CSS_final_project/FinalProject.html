	<p>This website represents my final project for an O&apos;Reilly School of Technology class I took in the spring (April through June) of 2013. Although I had created and published web pages back in 2000, used basic HTML coding for my job, and studied HTML over the last couple years on my own (e.g., through lynda.com and Codecademy), resulting in the creation of various HTML pages, I knew there were gaps in my learning. </p>

	<p>My goals were to make sure I had systematically learned all I needed to know for a basic understanding of HTML and CSS (and learned it correctly), to have questions resolved, to clear away some of the cobwebs of confusion that had built up in my mind, to establish credibility by completing a reputable class, and frankly, to have fun. </p>
	
	<p>I love exploring and learning new things. And I love written languages (witness my immersion in studying various languages and translating texts in a previous life)...poking around in them, figuring out how they work, figuring out what things mean, figuring out <del>how to translate an ancient Buddhist text by comparing different versions and languages</del>, er, or in the case of HTML and CSS, how to get a web page to act in a certain way and why it may not be acting as expected. </p>

	<h2>Requirements for the Final Project</h2>
	<p>As the final project, this website must:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Include elements and properties discussed in both the HTML and CSS portions of the course.</li>
		<li>Use an external CSS file for all the pages on the site.</li>
		<li>Observe good programming practices.</li>
		<li>Validate against the W3 online validator.</li>
		<li>Use good names for ids and classes.</li>
				<li>Use indentation to make the code readable.</li>
				<li>Be well-organized, professional, easy to navigate, and aesthetically pleasing, with no typos or syntax 		
		errors.</li>
				<li>Work with:
				<ul>
					<li>IE on Windows</li>
					<li>FireFox on Windows</li>
					<li>Safari on Mac</li>
						<li>Chrome on Mac</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
	
		<p>Be creative and have fun! You want to present yourself in a professional yet friendly way, so feel free to express yourself!</p>
