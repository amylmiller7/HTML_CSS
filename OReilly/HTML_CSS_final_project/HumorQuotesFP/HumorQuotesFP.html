	<p class="quotes_font">Every once in a while we need to take a deep breath, step back, and take life a little less seriously. Play is essential to creativity...not to mention that it can be the lubricant for some serious breakthroughs in <strong>Projects That Just Won&apos;t Come Unstuck</strong>. Silliness may be just what the doctor ordered. And laughter really is the best medicine. So go ahead. Be kind to yourself. Take a break. Go out for a skip. Hum a song of your choice or sing it at the top of your lungs. Invite stares. Or at the very least smiles from strangers. And for the less adventurous...those not quite daring enough to buck societal norms...simply read on....relax. Smile. Laugh.  It&apos;s ok. <strong>The Serious Stuff of Life</strong> will still be there when you&apos;re done being silly. </p><br>
